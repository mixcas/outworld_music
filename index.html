    <h2>Ritualz</h2>
    <h1>OUTWORLD MUSIC</h1>
    <p>Born as a series of releases between tours, the outworld music EPs were initially meant to be outlets for musical experiments with different styles without departing so much from ritualz's sound that it could turn into a side project. Planned to be 4 chapters long, these individually themed releases would eventually become part of a larger concept that came to be during two years of travels.</p>

    <p>Outworld Music then is a journey that starts with the exploration of human emotions, following primitive human nature turns to the occult and mystic in search of a deeper meaning to existence. Not content with relying in the credence of higher powers then leads into the exploration of our relationship with nature and the conclusion that all things eventually arrive at the inevitable and absolute: death.</p>

    <p>Man, myth, nature, death.</p>

    <p>This is the end.</p>

    <p>Outworld Musicis out now on Bandcamp, iTunes and Google Play through MALIGNA and will be available physically on 04/09/14</p>
