    <h2>Ritualz</h2>
    <h1>OUTWORLD MUSIC</h1>
    <p>Born as a series of releases between tours, ritualz's outworld music EPs were initially meant to be outlets for musical experiments with different styles without departing so much from ritualz's style that it could turn into a side project. planned to be 4 chapters long, these individually themed releases would eventually become part of a greater concept that came to be during two years of travels.</p>

    <p>Outworld Music is a journey that starts with the exploration of human emotions, following primitive human nature it turns to the occult and mystic in search of a deeper meaning to existence and not content with relying in the credence of higher powers it leads into the exploration of our relationship with nature and the conclusion that all things eventually arrive at the inevitable and absolute: death.</p>

    <p>Man, myth, nature, death.</p>

    <p>This is the end.</p>

    <p>Outworld Music is now collected and will be released through mexico city's MALIGNA on 08/26/14 on CD and digital.</p>
